**Differentiable programming** is a programming paradigm in which complex computer programs (including those with control flows and data structures) can be differentiated end-to-end automatically, enabling gradient-based
optimization of parameters in the program.

With differentiable programming, while the overall structure of the program is typically designed by a human, parameters of the program (such as weights in a neural network) can be automatically adjusted to achieve a task or optimize a criterion. This paradigm has also been referred to as “software 2.0”.

Algorithms that use first and second derivatives are known as first-order and second-order algorithms, respectively.

Differentiable programming is also concerned with the design of principled differentiable operations. In fact, much research on differentiable programming has been devoted to make classifical computer programming operations compatible with autodiff.



Notes:
- Heaviside step function == unit step function

- A logistic function or logistic curve is a common S-shaped curve (sigmoid curve) with the equation:
$$f(x) = \frac{L}{1+e^{-k(x-x_0)}}$$
